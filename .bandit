# Bandit security scanner configuration
# See: https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html

# Exclude test files and example scripts
exclude_dirs:
  - /tests/
  - /examples/
  - /.venv/
  - /venv/

# Only skip truly informational checks that aren't actionable:
# B404 - import subprocess (informational only, the actual usage is checked by B603/B607)
skips:
  - B404

# All other checks remain ACTIVE to catch new security issues.
# Use inline "# nosec BXXX" comments on specific lines where usage is verified safe.
#
# Common patterns requiring # nosec annotations:
# - B603/B607: subprocess with hardcoded command arrays (safe)
# - B310: urllib with timeout in **kwargs (safe, but Bandit can't detect)
# - B110/B112: try/except/pass for parsing external data (safe if intentional)
# - B101: assert in dev tools only (safe in non-production code)
# - B104: bind 0.0.0.0 for local services (safe if intentional)
# - B323/B501: unverified SSL when user explicitly disables (safe if logged/warned)
